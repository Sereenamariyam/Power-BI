## Sales Analysis Dashboard


## Problem Statement


This dashboard helps businesses understand their sales performance across various dimensions such as region, segment, and product category. By analyzing sales, profit, quantity sold, and discount data, the company can identify which areas are driving revenue and which need improvement.

It highlights that while certain sub-categories like Phones and Chairs are performing exceptionally well, other categories like Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes contribute very little to overall sales. This indicates a need to reassess marketing strategies or product relevance for those underperforming areas.

Additionally, the South and West regions show higher sales compared to Central and East, suggesting the potential to strengthen market reach in the weaker regions.

By addressing these discrepancies and understanding customer purchase behavior across segments (like Consumer vs Corporate), the company can make data-driven decisions to boost profitability, optimize inventory, and enhance regional performance.
